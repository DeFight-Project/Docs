# How to mint $FGT Power

To get the Reverb token you will need to purchase $Fuzz and add it to the Manual Pool (https://fuzz.fi/pools) then you will receive the REVERB tokens in a 1:1 Fuzz ratio. In possession of your REVERB tokens, go to the DeFight.one/fgt website and connect your wallet, then choose the “mint” option Note: Your NFT Cards must be in the wallet to allow minting the FGT token at the ratio of 100 FGT / NFT Card Important: You will not be able to unstake your Fuzz in proportion to the amount of REVERB used. But you will continue to receive fuzz income
