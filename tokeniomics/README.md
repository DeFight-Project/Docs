# Tokeniomics

Defight has a desire to be a broadly community project. It is essential that all your Tokenomy is 100% owned by the community.

Default will have two types of tokens:\
\- non-fungible (NFT Card) \
\- fungible tokens - governance ($FGT).

The community controls 100% of the NFT Cards token supply&#x20;

Step one, you need at least one NFT Card (but we highly recommend having multiples).

### Supply&#x20;

* 88,888 NFT Cards for mint&#x20;
* 44,400,000 $FGT (Governance Tokens)&#x20;

Other lots can only be made available after voting by the DAO with all the proposed specifications.

### NFT Cards Mining Economy & Logic

All NFT Cards start with ZERO mining power. Each Cards will have an initial range of 100 $DFT points to stock your NFY Card as you prefer. Exclusively for this first supply of $DFT you will need to lie using Reverb tokens in a 1:1 ratio. (1 Reverb = 1 FGT )

### Delivery Schedule&#x20;

Pre-Launch First come, first served.

* NFT Cards = 8,888 Cards&#x20;
* $FGT to mint = 888,800 tokens

Official Release NFT Cards = 80,000 FGT Tokens = 8,000,000
