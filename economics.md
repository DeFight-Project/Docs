Phase 1 Fee = 250 wONE / NFT Card (Launch discount 50%) + 100 Fuzz / Reverb Token

* 90% will revert to $fuzz and will be used to start liquidity in the pool (FGT-Fuzz in Fuzz Finance) for the official launch
* 10% reverted to marketing investments for the official launch

Phase 2

Fee = 500 wONE + Reverb Token Reserves: 35,511,200 - Tokens that will be added to the treasury for constant supply of battle rewards.

The strategy of using 3pool CRV as an initial liquidity supply will allow us to make strategic moves to always seek continuous and long-term evolution. The revenues generated by 3pool will be distributed in the form of dividends to FGT token holders. There are two forms of revenue: USD and CRV.

We will use CRV tokens to expand investments in other network platforms that work with CRV pools.

It will also be necessary to provide resources for development, marketing actions and investments.
