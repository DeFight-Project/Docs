# Battles

Then the big moment has arrived. You've found an opponent and they want to duel their cards. How does it work?

Choose 3 attributes. Your opponent will also choose 3 attributes. The attribute chosen in common by the 2 participants will be used in the battle. Your NFT will be locked for 48h during the fight, just like your opponent's card. During this period the battle will already be underway.

The result is very simple: The NFT that produces the highest amount of $wONE in the period will be the winner.

You have 48 hours to promote the fight if you want. You can choose to mobilize the community of the projects you invest in to try to maximize your APRs and help your card win the battle, and then conquer your opponent's NFT.\
Each round will be worth 100 governance tokens - $FGT - which will be used as a ranking score. These tokens are added to and deducted from your Card each battle. You can challenge or be challenged by another opponent with a maximum difference of 300 $FGT. If you win the battle of an opponent with less $FGT than you, you will receive less $FGT in the win. If you beat an opponent with more points, then you will earn more points in the victory. (The same applies to defeats - Mechanics similar to Chess)

Other users (audience) will be able to bet on your battle through the FuzzBet platform. You will be able to profit from your battle and the community that has bet on you as well.

The Super Card holder is not required to use/present the SuperCard title. Let's assume your opponent is a Special Card, but you are confident in your NFT power, you will be able to battle and win without having to use your "super power". If you win the battle without using the SuperCard title, you will get a Special Card. But if you lose the battle against a Special Card, it won't do any good to use your SuperCard title. Special Cards will override in your favor.

But with any other Card you will be able to reverse an unfavorable decision using your super power after the battle is over.
