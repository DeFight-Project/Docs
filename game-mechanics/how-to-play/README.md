# How to play

The game is defined by betting "NFT Cards" that have quantitative yields and can be played according to their yield performance compared to the opponent's. All NFT Cards are first mint. That is, they have ZERO mining value and must be supplied to start the game. Once all NFT Cards are minted 1 of them will be awarded as “Super Card”, and another 50 Cards will be awarded as Special Cards.&#x20;
