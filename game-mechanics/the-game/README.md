# The Game

The game is defined by betting "NFT Cards" that have quantitative yields and can be played according to their yield performance compared to the opponent's. All NFT Cards are first mint. That is, they have ZERO mining value and must be supplied to start the game. Once all NFT Cards are minted 1 of them will be awarded as “Super Card”, and another 50 Cards will be awarded as Special Cards.&#x20;

NFT Cards Mining and Fighting NFT Cards. You will be able to add Staked Tokens (xxToken) to your NFT and receive the income in wONE. Your skills will be decisive at the time of battle.\
Special Cards Are the only ones capable of reversing the SuperCard result. But it is indifferent to the other Cards. Super Card Defeats all Cards, regardless of their abilities, but is only defeated by Special Cards.

You'll be able to customize your Card with the abilities you prefer. Each skill will be represented by a Token Staked from a project on the Harmony network that are connected to Defight and generate income. With your Cards in hand, you can battle whoever you want or whoever is available for the fight. Skill information will only be visible to the Card holder. Neither the audience nor the opponent will know your Card information before battle. Only your history, just like you can't know the information of opposing cards. That doesn't mean you can't track them down and compose a database that you or your team can develop. It's everyone's strategy. As points can be distributed to allow you to update (increase or decrease) your card after each battle, this information will always be variable.

Battles Then the big moment has arrived. You've found an opponent and they want to duel their cards. How does it work?

Choose 3 attributes. Your opponent will also choose 3 attributes. The attribute chosen in common by the 2 participants will be used in the battle. Your NFT will be locked for 48h during the fight, just like your opponent's card. During this period the battle will already be underway.

The result is very simple: The NFT that produces the highest amount of $wONE in the period will be the winner.

You have 48 hours to promote the fight if you want. You can choose to mobilize the community of the projects you invest in to try to maximize your APRs and help your card win the battle, and then conquer your opponent's NFT.\
Each round will be worth 100 governance tokens - $FGT - which will be used as a ranking score. These tokens are added to and deducted from your Card each battle. You can challenge or be challenged by another opponent with a maximum difference of 300 $FGT. If you win the battle of an opponent with less $FGT than you, you will receive less $FGT in the win. If you beat an opponent with more points, then you will earn more points in the victory. (The same applies to defeats - Mechanics similar to Chess)

Other users (audience) will be able to bet on your battle through the FuzzBet platform. You will be able to profit from your battle and the community that has bet on you as well.

The Super Card holder is not required to use/present the SuperCard title. Let's assume your opponent is a Special Card, but you are confident in your NFT power, you will be able to battle and win without having to use your "super power". If you win the battle without using the SuperCard title, you will get a Special Card. But if you lose the battle against a Special Card, it won't do any good to use your SuperCard title. Special Cards will override in your favor.

But with any other Card you will be able to reverse an unfavorable decision using your super power after the battle is over. Result The result of the battle will be announced automatically by the platform contract. Everyone will know the result immediately after the 48 hours are up, including whether the SuperCards was triggered.
