# Mining Battle NFT Game

## Defight Project Proposal&#x20;

The central idea at the core of this game is to involve the entire harmony community and its main and most serious network projects, giving its investment and governance tokens yet another utility in a game environment . Game users will be able to form their own mining setups within the battle NFT. Each xToken will be responsible for one of the attributes of the Card that will be used in battle. Think of it as a robot battle where each competitor has their advantages and disadvantages, faster, stronger, fire resistant, etc.

The user will be able to upgrade his NFT by adding income power to it. The NFT Card then has an income that will be converted into wONE paid to the NFT holder user.

In these NFT Cards we will have comparison equivalences which will be possible to use in a battle. The winner of the battle wins the opponent's NFT with all its mining capacity (tokens added in NFT). Battle NFT Cards must follow a chronological list to be chosen for a duel.

For example: If you use CARD #00001 in a duel, after the battle it will be reordered to the end of the list of NFT Cards that the user has and can only be used again when it is his turn, or after (Determine a period). This allows the game user to have a wider range of strategies and acquire as many cards as possible. Cards will be limited but freely traded on the NFT market.

In order not to allow it to be a simple Pay-to-win game and thus make it a financial fair play, in each battle cycle it will be allowed to add a LIMITED amount of "power points" to the NFT Card. This mechanic will be defined by the governance token. Therefore, the player will need to have a good point distribution strategy to have a competitive Card.

There will also be some special situations that will give the game an element of surprise that could reverse an unfavorable decision. Obviously this will be a rare mechanism. After the outcome of the battle, the winner must immediately make decisions that cannot be changed until the next battle.

The game will also allow for multi-level strategies. You can be the fighter, the trainer, the technical trainer or the training sparring partner. Thus, it will be possible to work as a team or individually. Everyone's choice.
